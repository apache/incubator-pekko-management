Marathon API Docker lookup example
==================================

This example demonstrates Marathon API discovery mechanism when an application runs inside a docker container in 
network bridge mode with automatic host port allocation.

Marathon API discovery mechanism uses Marathon API to find other application instances (contact points) to form a Pekko cluster.
In order to identify contact points it uses a label assigned to the application in the application description and 
a port name to identify Pekko HTTP management port:

Label need to be defined in two places. 
First place is the application configuration:
see `integration-test/marathon-api-docker/src/main/resources/application.conf`:
```
    pekko.management.cluster.bootstrap.contact-point-discovery.effective-name = "marathon-api-docker-app-label"
```

> NOTE: if `effective-name` is not defined explicitly then Discovery Mechanism will use concatenation of
> `service-name` and `.service-namespace` if any of them defined in the application config. Otherwise, it will use
> the application ActorSystem name.

The second place is the application description:
see `marathon/marathon-api-docker-app.json`:
```
  ...
  "labels": {
    "ACTOR_SYSTEM_NAME": "marathon-api-docker-app-label"
  }
  ...

```

> NOTE: Discovery Mechanism uses `ACTOR_SYSTEM_NAME` label name as a part of Marathon API query param to find relevant contact points.
> This default value can be overridden in the application config `pekko.discovery.marathon-api.app-label-query`

After Discovery mechanism found potential contact points by the label it needs to find Pekko HTTP management port.

It uses `app-port-name`:
see `src/main/resources/application.conf`:
```
...
pekko.discovery.marathon-api.app-port-name = "pekkomgmthttp"
... 
``` 

it should match with Pekko HTTP management port name in Marathon application description docker port declaration:
see `marathon/marathon-api-docker-app.json`:
```
...
  "container": {
    "type": "DOCKER",
    "docker": {
      ...
      "portMappings": [
        ...
        {
          "containerPort": 8558,
          "hostPort": 0,
          "servicePort": 10206,
          "protocol": "tcp",
          "name": "pekkomgmthttp"
...
```

How to Build
------------

1. Set DOCKER_USER env variable and authenticated to your docker hub account:

`export DOCKER_USER=<your-docker-hub-account>`

2. In order to build and publish this example into your docker hub repo run next command from `pekko-management` work folder

`sbt integration-test-marathon-api-docker/docker:publish`

How to Deploy
-------------

Use next template for Marathon application descriptor. 

`marathon/marathon-api-docker-app.json`

> NOTE: Make sure to substitute $DOCKER_USER in it to point to your docker hub repo.
